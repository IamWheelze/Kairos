## Experiment Title: Initial Testing of Voice-Activated Presentation System

### Objective
To evaluate the basic functionalities of the Voice-Activated Presentation System, focusing on audio recording, speech recognition, and command execution.

### Setup
- Environment: [Specify environment details, e.g., Python version, libraries]
- Hardware: [Specify hardware details, e.g., microphone, speakers]
- Software: [List any software dependencies or tools used]

### Methodology
1. **Audio Recording**: Test the audio recording functionality using the `recorder.py` module.
2. **Speech Recognition**: Run inference on recorded audio using the ASR model defined in `model.py` and `infer.py`.
3. **Command Execution**: Validate the intent recognition and command execution through the presentation controller.
